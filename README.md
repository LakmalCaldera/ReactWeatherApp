# react-project-boilerplate
This is a boilerplate app to get you started with a react project using webpack

# Requirments
Node must be installed.

# Installing project dependencies
```javascript
npm install
```

# Running the server(Express)
Before running the server make sure to create the bundle.js via webpack by running the following command
```javascript
wepack
```
Now, you can start the server via,
```javascript
node server.js
```

# Browsing the app
Visit [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) on your browser

# Continue development with webpack
```javascript
webpack -w
```
Calling watch on webpack will make development easier, without you have to build the bundle.js file each time you do an update to the project.
